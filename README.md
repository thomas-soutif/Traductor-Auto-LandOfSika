# Traductor-Auto-LandOfSika

A tool to translate all the XML files of the mod project The Land Of Sika

With an abstraction of the translator API, will be implementable by an abstract class
I will implement the DEEPL API , you could do your own if you want

The verison 1.0 is now available ! =) The translation works with DeepL

I'm currently preparing a documentation on how to install and use the projet, thanks for your waiting !
